<p>I Like to play Badminton because  it's an indoor sport, so you can play it any time of the year, any time of day and it's a great social event where you can have fun with friends who are beginners and also friends that really know how to play. The better you get at badminton, the more and more fun it is!When I Get Free I Definately Play With My Friends And Also With My Brother And Sister. It Makes Us Feel Great And If You Will Play It One Time You Will Surely Play It Daily.</p>
